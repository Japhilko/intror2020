### This is base R:

![](figure/BasisR.PNG)


## Graphical user interface

But many people use a graphical user interface (GUI) or a integrated development interface (IDE).

For the following reasons:

- Syntax highlighting
- Auto-completion
- Better overview on graphics, libraries, files, ...

## Various text editors / IDEs

- [**Gedit**](https://projects.gnome.org/gedit/) with R-specific Add-ons for Linux

- [**Emacs**](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and ESS (Emacs speaks statistics)- An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor — and more.

- I use [**Rstudio!**](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## R as a calculator

```{r}
3 + 2 / 10^2 # Uses PEMDAS convention (order of operations)
3 + (2 / 10^2)
(3 + 2) / 10^2
```


```{r}
1 /19^4 # scientific notation is used for large numbers
1/0 # Undefined calculations
Inf - Inf
```

## Exercise: Preparation

- Check if R is installed on your computer.
- If not, download [**R**](r-project.org) and install it.
- Check if Rstudio is installed.
- If not - [**install**](http://www.rstudio.com/) Rstudio.
- Start RStudio. Go to the console (lower left window) and write

```{r,eval=F}
3+2
```

- If there is not already an editor open in the upper left window, then go to the file menu and open a new script. Check the date with `date()` and the R version with `sessionInfo()`.

```{R,eval=F}
date()
```

```{R,eval=F}
sessionInfo()
```


## Exercise: See where things happen

- Create a new `.R` script named `my_first_script.R`
- Write and execute the following code in the `.R` script and identify
where in Rstudio the outputs can be found.

```{r,eval=F}
mtcars
?sum
hist(mtcars$mpg)
random_numbers <- runif(40)
history()
```

## R is a object-orientiented language

### Vectors and assignments

-  R is a object-orientiented language
-  `<-` is the assignment operator

```{r}
b <- c(1,2) # create an object with the numbers 1 and 2
```
-  A function can be applied to this object:

```{r}
mean(b) # computes the mean
```

We can learn something about the properties of the object:

```{r}
length(b) # b has the length 2
sqrt(b) # the square root of b
```



## Functions in base-package

|Function |Meaning            |Example   |
|:--------|:------------------|:---------|
|str()    |Object structure   |str(b) |
|max()    |Maximum            |max(b)    |
|min()    |Minimum            |min(b)    |
|sd()     |Standard deviation |sd(b)     |
|var()    |Variance           |var(b)    |
|mean()   |Mean               |mean(b)   |
|median() |Median             |median(b) |

These functions only need one argument.

## Functions with more arguments

### Other functions need more arguments:

|Argument   |Meaning           |Example        |
|:----------|:-----------------|:--------------|
|quantile() |90 % Quantile     |quantile(b,.9) |
|sample()   |Draw a sample     |sample(b,1)    |

 

```{r}
quantile(b,.9)
sample(b,1) 
```

## Examples - Functions with more than one argument

```{r}
max(b); min(b)
sd(b); var(b)
```

### Functions with one argument

```{r}
mean(b)
median(b)
```


## Exercise: Assignments and functions

Create a vector `b` with the numbers from 1 to 5 and calculate ...


1. the mean

2. the variance

3. the standard deviation

4. the square root from the mean

![Overview commands](figure/UebersichtBefehle.PNG)



## Exercise: Economic Order Quantity Model

### Economic Order Quantity Model

$$
Q = \sqrt{\dfrac{2DK}{h}}
$$

### Calculate $Q$ where:

- D = 1000
- K = 5
- h = 0.25




## [R Data Types](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~nolan/stat133/Fall05/lectures/DataTypes4.pdf)

- R supports a  few basic data types: integer,  numeric,  logical, character/string, factor,  and complex

### Logical

– binary, two possible values represented by `TRUE` and `FALSE`

```{r}
x <- c(3,7, 1, 2)
x > 2
x == 2
!(x < 3)
which(x > 2)
```


## [Character vectors](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~nolan/stat133/Fall05/lectures/DataTypes4.pdf)

```{r}
y <- c("a","bc","def")
length(y)
nchar(y)
y == "a"
y == "b"
```

## Object structure

```{r}
str(b) # b is a numeric vector
```

### Variable type `character` 

```{r}
a <- letters
length(letters)
a[1:4]
str(a)
```

## Problems with character vector

```{r}
mean(b)
```

```{r,warning=T}
(b1 <- c(b,"a"))
mean(b1)
```



## Coercion

- All elements in a vector must be of the same type. R coerces the elements to a common type
- `c(1.2,3,TRUE)` – In this case all elements are coerced to numeric.

```{r}
x <- c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
c(1.2,x)
y <- c("2","3",".2")
c(1.2,y, x)
```


- Sometimes this coercion occurs to perform an arithmetic operation:

```{r}
1 + x
```

## Perform the coercion

- Other times we need to perform the coercion

```{r}
c(1.2,y)
c(1.2,as.numeric(y))
```

## Information about Vectors 

<!--
- `length(x)`- number of elements in a vector
-->

- Aggregator functions - `sum`, `mean`, `range`, `min`, `max`, `summary`, `table`, `cut`, ...

- `class(x)` – returns the type of an object.

- `is.logical(x)` –  tells us whether the object is a  logical type.   There is also `is.numeric`, `is.character`, `is.integer` 

- `is.null` – determines whether an object is empty, i.e. has no content.
’NULL’ is used mainly to represent the lists with zero length, and
is often returned by expressions and functions whose value is undefined.


## Coerce objects from one to another

- `as.numeric(x)` – we use the as-type functions to coerce objects from one type (e.g. logical) to another, in this case numeric. 
- There are several of these functions, including `as.integer`, `as.character`, `as.logical`
<!--
, `as.POSIXct`.
-->

```{r}
x <- c("1",2,"one","1plus","2_and")
as.numeric(x)
```



## Data Frames

<!--
A data frame is more general than a matrix - different columns can have different modes (numeric, character, factor, etc.). This is similar to SAS and SPSS datasets.
-->

A data frame is a collection of vectors - different columns can have different modes (numeric, character, factor, etc.).

### Three example vectors

```{r}
d <- c(1,2,3,4)
e <- c("red", "white", "red", NA)
f <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE)
```


### Bind the example vectors together:

```{r}
mydata <- data.frame(d,e,f)
```

### Give the columns some names

```{r}
names(mydata) <- c("ID","Color","Passed") # variable names
```



## Identify the elements of a data frame

There are a variety of ways to identify the elements of a data frame .

```{r,eval=F}
myframe[3:5] # columns 3,4,5 of data frame
myframe[c("ID","Age")] # columns ID and Age from data frame
myframe$X1 # variable x1 in the data frame 
```



## [Matrices](https://www.statmethods.net/input/datatypes.html)

All columns in a matrix must have the same mode (numeric, character, etc.) and the same length. The general format is:

```{r,eval=F}
# generates 5 x 4 numeric matrix
y <- matrix(1:20, nrow=5,ncol=4)
```


- `byrow=TRUE` indicates that the matrix should be filled by rows. 
- `byrow=FALSE` - matrix should be filled by columns (the default). 

```{r}
# an example
cells <- c(1,26,24,68)
mymatrix <- matrix(cells, nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE) 
```

## Matrix - dimnames


- `dimnames` provides optional labels for the columns and rows. 

```{r}
# another example
rnames <- c("R1", "R2")
cnames <- c("C1", "C2")
mymatrix <- matrix(cells, nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE,
  dimnames=list(rnames, cnames)) 
```



## Matrices and subscripts

Identify rows, columns or elements using subscripts. 

```{r,eval=F}
x[,4] # 4th column of matrix
x[3,] # 3rd row of matrix
x[2:4,1:3] # rows 2,3,4 of columns 1,2,3 
```


## Lists

An ordered collection of objects (components). A list allows you to gather a variety of (possibly unrelated) objects under one name.

```{r,eval=F}
# example of a list with 4 components -
# a string, a numeric vector, a matrix, and a scaler
w <- list(name="Fred", mynumbers=a, mymatrix=y, age=5.3)

# example of a list containing two lists
v <- c(list1,list2)
```


Identify elements of a list using the [[ ]] convention.

```{r,eval=F}
mylist[[2]] # 2nd component of the list
mylist[["mynumbers"]] # component named mynumbers in list
```


## [**Where to find routines**](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/seminars/intro/)

```{r,eval=T,echo=F}
# http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/06/how-many-packages-are-there-really-on-cran.html
CRANmirror <- "http://cran.revolutionanalytics.com"
cran <- contrib.url(repos = CRANmirror, 
                      type = "source")
info <- available.packages(contriburl = cran, type = "source")
# nrow(info)
```



- Many functions are included in basic R 
- Many specific functions are integrated in additional libraries
- R can be modularly extended by so-called packages or libraries
- Most important packages hosted on CRAN (`r nrow(info)` at `r format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d")`)
- Further packages can be found e.g. at [**bioconductor**](www.bioconductor.org)
